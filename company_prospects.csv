In the next 6 months, the Group will continue to focus on capacity expansion, aggressive material sourcing and securing, supply chain collaboration, key markets expansion, new product innovation, and COVID-19 risk mitigation to support the robust demand from various sectors, especially in 5G, Electric Vehicles (“EV”), Computing and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)."
Apr-21,UWC Berhad,"Malaysia was placed under the Movement Control Order (""MCO"") from May 12 to June 7, as the country grappled with the rising COVID-19 cases. With its activities being categorised as essential services, UWC was allowed to operate at 60% capacity during this Phase 3 of the MCO. Throughout this challenging period, the Group did not receive any order cancellation. On top of that, enquires kept flowing in from existing and potential customers for both semiconductor and life science industries. The Group also took the necessary preventive measures to minimize the impact caused by COVID-19 during our operations. BNM expects Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth to remain on track and expand by 6.0% to 7.5% in 2021. According to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics, the global semiconductor market is projected to grow by 8.4% in 2021, driven by double-digit growth of Memory and Optoelectronics. All other product categories are also expected to show positive growth rates, and all regions are expected to grow in 2021. The semiconductor market overall is not significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as originally feared earlier this year. Therefore, UWC remains optimistic of the prospects of the businesses and industries in which UWC operates in for the coming years. SEMICONDUCTOR Semiconductor orders remain very strong along with the continuous increasing number of enquiries and orders received from existing and potential customers, both locally and directly from their global headquarters. The Group continues to broaden its customer base by securing new customers as well as working closely with the existing customers in new product developments and project transfer. Hence, UWC expects to have more new products in the foreseeable future. Following the foreseeable stronger demand for chip testers and test handlers in the coming quarters, orders for logic chip testers remain very strong due to our new strategy to continue to invest in our own foundry. In addition, global semiconductor production is on the rise to meet increasing demand and ease the ongoing chip shortage affecting the automotive sector and others, and thus annual sales are projected to increase in 2021. Automotive chip tester delivery by UWC has begun and is ramping up strongly. UWC is expanding its space for auto chip tester manufacturing where 24 CNC machines will be equipped with robots to automate material handling. UWC is putting more emphasis on front-end and automated test equipment customers to grow the business segments. The Group will gradually exit heavy duty business by relocating the production floor in order to dedicate capacity to more profitable and higher margin segments by undertaking the manufacturing of front-end semiconductor equipment, automated test equipment and 5G test equipment. Furthermore, for the autonomous vehicle reliability chip testers, the Group expects mass production to commence by end 2021. Meanwhile, UWC has been engaged by a key customer to develop and manufacture the world’s highest frequency 5G OTA (over-the-air) chamber. UWC has been the Customer’s strategic partner in supporting the manufacturing of its test equipment which is en-route for mass production roll-out. CAPACITY EXPANSION The Group has completed the class 10k cleanroom, and will be fully utilised to cater for front-end semiconductor equipment high level assembly, where UWC has sent one prototype for qualification and testing purposes. In addition, there are newly expanded areas for paint jobs with in-house automation. Furthermore, UWC is identifying an additional plant to lease in the near future, in order to increase capacity and ensure that the Group will have sufficient capacities to roll out more high valued projects. Aligned with the business expansion and Industry 4.0 progression, the Group has invested in new CNC machines such as robotic arm and cobot for quality enhancement and better efficiency. LIFE SCIENCE As for the life-science and medical technology segments, the order pipeline for COVID-19 related virus test equipment remains robust following the increase in sporadic cases and presence of several highly contagious variants of the virus. Given our involvement in the manufacturing of such equipment, the Group expects sustainable substantial growth in the coming years as the application of this test equipment will be able to cater to other/ new virus strains. Given the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, UWC’s life science and medical technology segments have benefited from the involvement in the medical and diagnostic testing, as well as delivery of virus extraction machines to its clients. Currently, we are in the midst of developing other medical equipment to test the mutated Covid-19 strains with our customers. We look forward to further improve our positioning in the growing markets and are optimistic that we will continue to deliver good performance in coming years through dedication and commitment to the Group."
Apr-21,NTPM Holdings Berhad,"With the persistent outbreak of COVID-19 infections, the economy continues to be shrouded with uncertainty. We are however hopeful that the intensified vaccination programme will curtail COVID-19 infections and give the economy greater confidence for recovery in 2022. Faced with the weakening economy, the Group continues to work diligently in the ‘new normal’ to turn external challenges into new opportunities and take proactive measures to meet the changing environment. To-date, despite the reduced production capacity during the various movement control order periods in Malaysia, the Group continues to be able to meet the customers’ demand proactively leveraging on the manufacturing operations in Malaysia and Vietnam. In the financial year ending 30 April 2022, the Board sees new challenges to the Group from the significant rebound in the prices of many key inputs. Since the beginning of the calendar year 2021, the prices of pulp and waste paper have risen significantly and so has the freight cost. The active management of the sourcing of raw materials and the supplies chain to optimise input cost is a critical management focus. However, it will not be able to avoid being severely affected by the rising pulp and wastepaper prices. Unless it can successfully pass on such cost increases to its customers while not affecting much the sale volume, the Group may not be able to maintain its current profit margin. Subject to the foregoing prerequisite, the Group is cautiously optimistic in its prospect in FY2022."
Mar-21,MQ Technology Berhad,Manufacturing business component The outlook for Group's tooling and precision components business is expected to maintain at the existing business level for the financial year 2021 .

Mar-21,IQ Group Holdings Berhad,"Having returned to profitability during FY20/21 in the midst of the global pandemic, we now look forward and are re-doubling our efforts to build upon this improved performance. Clearly the focus on cost reduction and business simplification over the past year has yielded positive results and we now continue our parallel focus on business growth such that we can further capitalise on this improved situation. Challenges remain, both with regard to varying levels of Covid-19 induced uncertainties, which still have ramifications on various markets as countries grapple with the challenges of fully opening their economies whilst protecting their people....and the fact that we are having to navigate our way through the current global semiconductor Chip shortages, which analysts predict could remain a challenge in to 2022. This Chip supply challenge is prompting us to creatively manage our forward planning and ordering of related materials, whilst we also address the issue via design adjustment to achieve greater levels of commonality to consolidate needs onto more readily available components. Having creatively and positively managed our way through the global challenges of last year, we are in an improved position to manage our way through the challenges of today. It is from this basis that we look forward to the results of our efforts as we maintain sustained focus towards establishing lower-mix/higher-volume business...and to the targeted prospects of business growth."
